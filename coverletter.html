					<h4>Dear Recuirement Team!</h4>
					<p> I am writing to express my strong interest in the Technology Consulting Graduate Programme at EY as advertised on your website. I am a third-year student majoring in Digital Media at the University of the West of England, and I am eager to contribute my entrepreneurial spirit and digital expertise to EY's innovative team.<br>

						My entrepreneurial journey began during high school when, at the age of 16, I started an online retail business selling clothing, shoes, and snacks. Using platforms like Facebook, I established a strong online presence. I specialized in importing products from China and making them available to Vietnamese customers. As my business grew, I expanded it with a strategy like a branching tree. I managed ten subsidiary branches, each offering tailored discounts and benefits to customers. This experience taught me about supply chain management, customer relationships, and how to identify market opportunities. In 2021, I shifted my business focus to the UK market, gaining valuable insights into international trade dynamics. This transition expanded my horizons and motivated me to explore further contributions in the field of technology consulting.<br>
						
						In addition to my entrepreneurial endeavors, I have been a volunteer Oversea Study Advisor since 2021, collaborating with an agency to guide Vietnamese students planning to study abroad. I provide advice on adjusting to new lifestyles, choosing academic majors, and overcoming academic challenges. I also help students to reach out with local business to get part-time jobs. My goal is to help students transition smoothly into their academic pursuits abroad.<br>
						
						I believe that my experiences as an Online-Retail Business Owner and Oversea Study Advisor make me well-suited for EY's Technology Consulting Graduate Programme. I am passionate about using technology to drive business growth and am eager to apply my digital media knowledge, problem-solving skills, and international perspective to assist EY's clients in navigating the evolving technological landscape.<br>
						
						EY's reputation for innovation, commitment to excellence, and its collaborative and inclusive work culture resonate with me. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to EY's mission and learning from the talented professionals within the organization.<br>
						
						I kindly request the opportunity to interview for this position. Enclosed is my CV, which offers a comprehensive overview of my qualifications and experiences.<br>
						
						I am sincerely appreciative of your time and consideration. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills can contribute to the continued success of EY.<br>
						
					
						
						</p>
						<p>	Sincerely,</p>
						<p>Huyen Thi Nguyen</p>
