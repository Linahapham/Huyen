					<h4>Dear Recuirement Team!</h4>
					<p> I am writing to express my strong interest in the Graduate Technology Deals Insights and Analytics role at PwC, as advertised on your website. I am a third-year student majoring in Digital Media at the University of the West of England, and I am eager to contribute my entrepreneurial spirit and digital expertise to Deals Insights and Analytics team.
					</p>
					<p>My entrepreneurial journey began during high school when, at the age of 16, I started an online retail business selling clothing, shoes, and snacks. Using platforms like Facebook, I established a strong online presence. I specialized in importing products from China and making them available to Vietnamese customers. As my business grew, I expanded it with a strategy like a branching tree. I managed ten subsidiary branches, each offering tailored discounts and benefits to customers. This experience taught me about supply chain management, customer relationships, and how to identify market opportunities. In 2021, I shifted my business focus to the UK market, gaining valuable insights into international trade dynamics. This transition expanded my horizons and motivated me to explore further contributions in the field of technology consulting.
					</p>
					<p>In addition to my entrepreneurial endeavors, I have been a volunteer Oversea Study Advisor since 2021, collaborating with an agency to guide Vietnamese students planning to study abroad. I provide advice on adjusting to new lifestyles, choosing academic majors, and overcoming academic challenges. I also help students to reach out with local business to get part-time jobs. My goal is to help students transition smoothly into their academic pursuits abroad. This role has honed my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively, a skill that will be invaluable in translating technical insights to non-technical stakeholders, as mentioned in your job description.
					</p>
					<p>I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join PwC, a globally recognized firm known for fostering innovation and personal development. I look forward to discussing how my background and skills can contribute to the Deals Insights and Analytics team.
					</p>
					<p>Enclosed is my resume, providing further details about my academic achievements, technical skills, and experiences. I would welcome the opportunity to interview and explore how I can contribute to PwC's continued success.
					</p>
					<p>Thank you for considering my application. I appreciate the chance to be part of PwC's outstanding team and eagerly await the opportunity to discuss my potential contribution.
					</p>
						<p>	Sincerely,</p>
						<p>Huyen Thi Nguyen</p>
